Okay what do I want to analyze??

run a student's T-test!

Let's first plot the data
Let's get a systematic bias
      Calculate the mean at every step
      Subtract it from the actual distance
      	       Get a mean value for that error and variance for that error
	       Plot that average error with its variance
	       	    -> Do certain combinations have more error?
		    Run a student's T-Test on each combo to see if the error is from the same distribution
		    
Let's calculate the variance @ every distance
      Plot that variance		    
	       
Questions:
	Does the error increase over time?

Provide Jamison the code I've written and all the data for him to do pretty up the display tomorrow
