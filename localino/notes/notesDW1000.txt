Asset location up to 10cm (Two Way ranging)
3.5 GHz to 6.5 GHz
Data rates of 110kbps, 850 kbps, 6.8 Mbps
SPI interface

The easiest solution to this would be to plug and play an Arduino module that gives two way ranging (That would be AWESOME) [and that worked...]

Things to test and develop:
- What the improvement in performance of doing a multichannel, multi prf round robin scheme versus the other methods of using single channel, dual channel
- Let's acquire data w/ respect to location accuracy and speed (possibly using the vicon space)
  	Build the model and get actual distance
	How can I improve my communication (prepare what I'm going to say and what slides to demonstate)
	Keep my updates short and to the point, maybe
	     What - Problem trying to solve
	     How - How I solved it
	     Why - Why this approach is good
	     What - Here's the results

Optimal
What: Answer questions:
      Consistency of errors across localinos?
      What's the error look like
      	     Further characterization
      Do we get interference on different frequencies?
      
How:    Can we do 2 localinos at a time?
	8 different tests with localinos
	write a program that requests a distance from the localino 100 times or so and averages?
	
Further questions:
	Does our API allow use to switch frequencies mid program?

Next steps:
     Answer further questions
     Add in simultaneous localization, get the range then send the data to the other guy
     Develop an algorithm to do that 4 ways
     Write ros nodes for interfacing with that
     Add in synchronousness

-------------------------------
Using the Arduino Library Testings
 - Let's analyze what the Arduino Code is doing
 - Let's start with the ranging code since that's where the bread is
 - Check if it works, if it doesn't where is it failing, follow the code
    
--> Once this works I'll want to record the accuracy, do some tests
--> Modify the arduino code so that the Anchor also can get range data
--> Rosnode interface and we're pretty much done
